S. pyogenes also causes severe invasive diseases including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).Recently, we reported that a region encoding the SalR-SalK two component regulatory system and the adjacent type I restriction modification system was deleted in some emm 1 type isolates (APMIS, Volume 122, Issue 10, pages 914-921, DOI: 10.1111/apm.12230). The isolates with the deletion were detected only in the emm 1 strains that were isolated after 2010, but not before 2010. we named the emm 1 strains with the deletion as a ""novel-type"" emm 1 strain. In a experiment using mouse invasive infection model, both of two novel emm 1 type strains (10-85 and 11-171) isolated from ""STSS"" patients were more virulent than a novel emm 1 type strain (11O-2) isolated from a ""non-STSS"" patient. In the present project, we performed whole genome sequences of strains 10-85, 11-171, and 11O-2, and searched them for some specific mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existing in only low-virulent strain 11O-2, but not strains 10-85 and 11-171."

Apart from vaccine antigen design, this programme of sequencing will support targeted analyses of specific disease associations and global transmission patterns of prominent sequence types- all ongoing sequencing based research foci that Sanger (Mark Davies) is currently analysing. PHASE 1. Hi-seq (n=750), Pacbio (n=30) and RNA-seq (n=48) Hi-seq (750) We currently have a collection of 750 genomes extracted and ready for Hi-seq (objective 1) - 90 South China and North China (15 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South America (40 emm types, 14 years) - 210 Southern Europe and Northern Europe (30 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South and North India (29 emm types, 5 years) - 350 New Zealand (53 emm types, 13 years) The sampling strategy is based on epidemiological (emm) patterns, temporal and clinical relevance in order to provide significant representation from all continents and all GAS clinical manifestations. Two things to reiterate: 1. The geographical and spatial epidemiology of GAS varies. Deep sampling is required for informed global vaccine design. page 1 [A5] Please state all collaborating PIs (and name of Institution) [A7] Is this a joint project with another Sanger PI, if so state name(s) [A9] Does this project use samples? [A10] Please choose which types of sample you will be using 2. The geographical locations being sampled are also being targeted as sites for future vaccine trials.

Apart from vaccine antigen design, this programme of sequencing will support targeted analyses of specific disease associations and global transmission patterns of prominent sequence types- all ongoing sequencing based research foci that Sanger (Mark Davies) is currently analysing. PHASE 1. Hi-seq (n=750), Pacbio (n=30) and RNA-seq (n=48) Hi-seq (750) We currently have a collection of 750 genomes extracted and ready for Hi-seq (objective 1) - 90 South China and North China (15 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South America (40 emm types, 14 years) - 210 Southern Europe and Northern Europe (30 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South and North India (29 emm types, 5 years) - 350 New Zealand (53 emm types, 13 years) The sampling strategy is based on epidemiological (emm) patterns, temporal and clinical relevance in order to provide significant representation from all continents and all GAS clinical manifestations.

PHASE 1. Hi-seq (n=750), Pacbio (n=30) and RNA-seq (n=48) Hi-seq (750) We currently have a collection of 750 genomes extracted and ready for Hi-seq (objective 1) - 90 South China and North China (15 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South America (40 emm types, 14 years) - 210 Southern Europe and Northern Europe (30 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South and North India (29 emm types, 5 years) - 350 New Zealand (53 emm types, 13 years) The sampling strategy is based on epidemiological (emm) patterns, temporal and clinical relevance in order to provide significant representation from all continents and all GAS clinical manifestations. Two things to reiterate: 1. The geographical and spatial epidemiology of GAS varies.

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers\; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices.	collected_by:Children's National Hospital

Hi-seq (n=750), Pacbio (n=30) and RNA-seq (n=48) Hi-seq (750) We currently have a collection of 750 genomes extracted and ready for Hi-seq (objective 1) - 90 South China and North China (15 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South America (40 emm types, 14 years) - 210 Southern Europe and Northern Europe (30 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South and North India (29 emm types, 5 years) - 350 New Zealand (53 emm types, 13 years) The sampling strategy is based on epidemiological (emm) patterns, temporal and clinical relevance in order to provide significant representation from all continents and all GAS clinical manifestations. Two things to reiterate: 1. The geographical and spatial epidemiology of GAS varies. Deep sampling is required for informed global vaccine design. page 1 [A5] Please state all collaborating PIs (and name of Institution) [A7] Is this a joint project with another Sanger PI, if so state name(s) [A9] Does this project use samples?

PHASE 1. Hi-seq (n=750), Pacbio (n=30) and RNA-seq (n=48) Hi-seq (750) We currently have a collection of 750 genomes extracted and ready for Hi-seq (objective 1) - 90 South China and North China (15 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South America (40 emm types, 14 years) - 210 Southern Europe and Northern Europe (30 emm types, 10 years) - 50 South and North India (29 emm types, 5 years) - 350 New Zealand (53 emm types, 13 years) The sampling strategy is based on epidemiological (emm) patterns, temporal and clinical relevance in order to provide significant representation from all continents and all GAS clinical manifestations. Two things to reiterate: 1. The geographical and spatial epidemiology of GAS varies.

In order to characterise the population of emm/M3 GAS within the UK and determine bacterial factors that might be responsible for this upsurge, 442 emm/M3 isolates from cases of invasive and non-invasive infections during the period 2001 to 2013 were subjected to whole genome sequencing. MLST analysis differentiated emm/M3 isolates into three sequence types (STs): ST15, ST315 and ST406. Analysis of the whole genome SNP-based phylogeny showed that the majority of isolates from the 2008-2009 upsurge period belonged to a distinct lineage characterised by the presence of a prophage carrying the speC exotoxin and spd1 DNAase genes but loss of two other prophages considered typical of the emm/M3 lineage. This lineage was significantly associated with the upsurge in iGAS cases and we postulate that the upsurge could be attributed in part to expansion of this novel prophage-containing lineage within the population. The study underlines the importance of prompt genomic analysis of changes in the GAS population, providing an advanced public health warning systems for newly emergent, pathogenic strains.

Macrolide- and tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes emm12 isolates represent the majority of clinical cases. Recently, we identified two mobile genetic elements that were closely associated with emm12 outbreak isolates: the integrative and conjugative element ICE-emm12, encoding genes for tetracycline and macrolide resistance, and prophage ?HKU.vir, encoding the superantigens SSA and SpeC, as well as the DNase Spd1. Here we sequenced the genomes of 141 emm12 isolates, including 132 isolated in Hong Kong between 2005 and 2011. We found that the introduction of several ICE-emm12 variants, ?HKU.vir and a new prophage, ?HKU.ssa, occurred in three distinct emm12 lineages late in the twentieth century. Acquisition of ssa and transposable elements encoding multidrug resistance genes triggered the expansion of scarlet fever-associated emm12 lineages in Hong Kong. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant ssa-harboring scarlet fever strains should prompt heightened surveillance within China and abroad for the dissemination of these mobile genetic elements. http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/streptococcus-pyogenes.html This data is part of a pre-publication release.

Pubmed ID: 25088811. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a commensal of the digestive and genitourinary tracts of humans that emerged as the leading cause of bacterial neonatal infections in Europe and North America during the 1960s. Due to the lack of epidemiological and genomic data, the reasons for this emergence are unknown. Here we show by comparative genome analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of 229 isolates that the rise of human GBS infections corresponds to the selection and worldwide dissemination of only a few clones. The parallel expansion of the clones is preceded by the insertion of integrative and conjugative elements conferring tetracycline resistance (TcR). Thus, we propose that the use of tetracycline from 1948 onwards led in humans to the complete replacement of a diverse GBS population by only few TcR clones particularly well adapted to their host, causing the observed emergence of GBS diseases in neonates."

June 2016			60		1864059	38.42	1981				blood	isolated from the blood of a human patient	2009	USA	United States						Human, Homo sapiens																			Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a strict human pathogen and almost 10% children carry this pathogen in their pharynx without signs or symptoms (Shaikh, Leonard et al., 2010). This pathogen causes diverse diseases from mild, self-limiting superficial infections to toxigenic or invasive diseases. The diseases include strep throat, impetigo, scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, rheumatic fever, and necrotizing fasciitis (Cunningham, 2000). We sequenced a serotype M3 strain isolated from the blood of a human patient. Often, serotype M3 strains cause an epidemic of invasive disease (Beres, Sylva et al., 2004). When we compared the genome sequence with publically available genome sequences of two serotype M3 strains, MGAS315 and SSI-1, the sequence of this strain was closer to the MGAS315 strain. However, unlike MGAS315, this strain secrets the cysteine protease SpeB, a major virulence factor in the GAS pathogenesis. It appears that this strain has not developed antibiotic resistance and is sensitive to the antibiotics of ampicillin, clindamycin, cefazolin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, penicillin, cefotaxime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin	sample_type:Cell Culture

The whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of MTB313 and MTB314 revealed that only MTB313 carried the amber codon within rocA (a positive regulator of covR). It is common knowledge that the CovR/CovS two-component regulatory system (also known as CsrR/CsrS) suppresses the expression of multiple virulence genes including hasA (hyaluronic acid [HA] capsule synthesis), whereas the covR/covS mutation enhances the expression of speB (cysteine protease) and does not affect the streptolysisn O (SLO) expression. First, MAT101 was generated from MTB313 by introducing pRocA, which contained the full-length rocA of MTB314 in the cloning plasmid pLZ12-Km2. Simultaneously, MAT100 was also generated by introducing pLZ12-Km2 into MTB313. Then, MTB313 and MAT100 showed the large quantities of cell-associated HA in the cell pellets and the small quantities of SpeB associated with low activities in the culture supernatants. In contrast, MTB314 and MAT101 showed the opposite results. Meanwhile, the SLO production was much the same among these four strains in the culture supernatants. Finally, when the mortality rates by two weeks of these four strains were examined in a CD46-expressing transgenic mouse model of subcutaneous infection into both hind footpads, the higher mortalities were observed in the MTB313- or MAT100-infected mice than in the MTB314- or MAT101-infected mice. These results clearly indicate that the point mutation in the rocA gene of S. pyogenes led to the high-pathogenicity phenotype associated with the suppression of covR expression, which occurred within the patient.;many frameshifted proteins;validation errors
